# JWT Authentication Implementation

## 🎉 Successfully Converted from Sessions to JWT!

Your React frontend has been completely updated to use JWT authentication instead of sessions. This will resolve the CORS issues you were experiencing between your Azure backend and Vercel frontend.

## 🔄 **What Changed**

### Backend Changes:
- ✅ Added JWT authentication with `JwtService`
- ✅ Implemented `JWTMiddleware` for token validation
- ✅ Updated all controllers to use JWT instead of sessions
- ✅ Configured JWT settings in `appsettings.json`
- ✅ Fixed CORS middleware ordering
- ✅ Removed `AllowCredentials()` from CORS (no longer needed)

### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ Created `AuthContext` for JWT token management
- ✅ Added `ProtectedRoute` component
- ✅ Updated `Login.jsx` to use JWT authentication
- ✅ Updated `Register.jsx` to use authentication context
- ✅ Converted `Game.jsx` from axios/sessions to JWT
- ✅ Added logout functionality to `Home.jsx`
- ✅ Removed email field from registration (backend doesn't use it)

## 🔧 **How It Works**

1. **Login**: Returns JWT token + username, stored in `localStorage`
2. **Authentication**: `AuthContext` manages token state and API calls
3. **Protected Routes**: Automatically redirect to login if no token
4. **API Calls**: All requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
5. **Logout**: Clears token from localStorage (stateless)

## 🚀 **To Deploy & Test**

### Backend:
```bash
cd GuessTheNumber.backend
dotnet build
# Deploy to Azure (your preferred method)
```

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend_react
npm install  # if needed
npm run dev  # for local testing
# Deploy to Vercel
```

## 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**

- ✅ **No More CORS Issues**: JWT tokens work seamlessly across domains
- ✅ **Stateless**: No server-side session management needed
- ✅ **Scalable**: Perfect for cloud deployments
- ✅ **Security**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Easy to extend to mobile apps

## 🧪 **Testing the Implementation**

1. **Register a new user** → Should work without CORS errors
2. **Login** → Should receive JWT token and redirect to home
3. **Play game** → All API calls should include JWT token
4. **Logout** → Should clear token and redirect to login
5. **Protected routes** → Should redirect to login when not authenticated

## 🔐 **Security Notes**

- Tokens are stored in `localStorage` (consider `httpOnly` cookies for production)
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Different JWT secrets for development vs production
- All API calls are properly authenticated

Your app should now work perfectly between Azure and Vercel without any CORS issues! 🎉
